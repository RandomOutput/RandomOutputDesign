							<strong>People have a lot of defenitions about what UX actually means.</strong> For me, the key role for a User Experience designer is two fold. The first is that a UX designer needs to have a deep understanding of the intended feel and outcomes of the product. Maintaining a consistant feel to the interactions across your product is as important as a consistant visual style. It lends conherency to the experience and lets users focus on what they're trying to do. The second goal of a UX designer is making sure those interactions are useable, enjoyable, and useful. Training the user on how your product works is of critical importance.

							<strong>I worked as an interactive designer</strong> with Jesse Lindsley and the team at Thrust Interactive for much of 2010 and early 2011. While at Thrust I worked on developing an internal project, Stimuli.st as well as worked with a variety of clients designing interactive solutions. On Stimuli.st I developed wireframes and flows for both our web and mobile clients, working with or UI artist to develop mocks and assets for development.  I also functioned in a product strategy role, working with Jesse to develop the larger plan for Stimuli.st's design direction, development, release, and maintence.

							In my work with Thrust's clients, I spent a large amount of time meeting with stakeholders to understand their goals and challenges. I would then work with the client and the team at Thrust to help develop web and mobile solutions for their needs. I did the initial design, client pitch, and flows for this <a href='http://unacceptable.arthritis.org/'>Arthritis is Unacceptable visualization",</a> though I had to move onto other projects as development was beginning.
